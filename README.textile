h2. NOTES

To browse the code on github make sure you disable greasemonkey because 
it thinks a page URL terminated with .user.js is a script, when in fact
it might be the html page to show the file info.

h2. INSTALLATION

This script requires that you have Grasemonkey installed on your Firefox,
so if you don't have it the first step is to go to 
"http://www.greasespot.net/":http://www.greasespot.net/ and install it.

After Grasemonkey installed, just go to 
"http://www.mamata.com.br/greasemonkey/":http://www.mamata.com.br/greasemonkey/
or "http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/37530":http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/37530
and click on the link to install it.

h2. USAGE

This script does not retrieve all your contact list, this script is made
to be simple and fast, so it will only autocomplete names that are on the
current page's timeline.

To use it, just start typing @ and the first letters of the name of the 
person you want to reply. If more than one person on that page shares the
beggining letters of the name, you can either continue to type the name 
until they differ or alternativelly type the Esc key to cycle through the
options.

When the prediction is correct, just type Tab or the Right Arrow key.
